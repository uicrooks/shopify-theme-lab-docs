# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Ruby v2.7+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en)
- [Shopify CLI v2+](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation)
- [Node.js v14+](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Installation

1. Install the Shopify CLI by following [these steps](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/cli/installation).

2. Create a [development store](https://shopify.dev/themes/tools/development-stores#create-a-development-store-to-build-and-test-your-theme).

3. Log out of your newly created store and then log in again using the `your-store.myshopify.com/admin` URL

::: tip
If you're the owner of the development store, then you need to log in to the store using the store URL at least once (for example, using your-store.myshopify.com/admin) before you can start using the Shopify CLI.
:::

4. Clone the Shopify Theme Lab repo or simply use the Shopify CLI.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="Shopify CLI" active>

```sh
shopify theme init -u https://github.com/uicrooks/shopify-theme-lab
```

  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="Git">

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/uicrooks/shopify-theme-lab.git" shopify-theme-lab
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

5. Install dependencies and run the `start` task.

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeGroupItem title="NPM" active>

```sh
npm install
npm run start --store
```

  </CodeGroupItem>

  <CodeGroupItem title="YARN">

```sh
yarn install
yarn start --store
```

  </CodeGroupItem>
</CodeGroup>

::: tip
You will be prompted the first time you deploy this command to login to your shopify partner account. Press any key when prompted in the terminal to open the login page.
:::

7. Open the development URL provided by the Shopify CLI. You may need to enter the store password before you can continue.
